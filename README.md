# ⏰ Analog With Digital Clock (AI‑Themed)

> **A Modern AI‑Inspired Analog & Digital Clock Web Application**
> Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, version‑controlled with **Git & GitHub**, and **deployed online via GitHub**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**AnalogWithDigital‑Clock** is a clean, interactive, and AI‑inspired web application that combines a **classic analog clock** with a **real‑time digital clock** in a single interface. The project focuses on precision time rendering, smooth animations, and modern UI design, inspired by intelligent systems and real‑time data processing concepts commonly used in AI applications.

This project is fully **frontend‑based**, lightweight, fast, and accessible directly from the browser. It is deployed online using **GitHub**, making it easy to share and showcase.
